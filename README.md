- [ ] Release the 8B Dopamine-Reward (GRM) model *(About 2 week)*.
- [ ] Release the Robo-Dopamine Dataset and SFT training code *(About 1 months)*.
- [ ] Release the Dataset Generation Pipeline *(Maybe 1 months or more)*.
- [ ] Release the Dopamine-RL training code for simulator and real-world settings *(Maybe 2 months or more)*.


## 🤖 Overview

**Robo-Dopamine** is composed of two core components: ***(a) Dopamine-Reward Modeling Method --*** At the heart of our reward modeling is to build the General Reward Model (GRM), a vision-language model that is prompted with a task description and conditioned on multi-view images of initial, goal, "BEFORE," and "AFTER" states to predict a relative progress or regress hop. To ensure a stable and accurate signal, we employ *Multi-Perspective Progress Fusion*, which combines incremental, forward-anchored, and backward-anchored predictions into a final fused reward. And ***(b) Dopamine-RL Training Framework --*** The Dopamine-RL framework first adapts the pre-trained GRM to a novel task using a single demonstration, i.e., *One-Shot GRM Adaptation*. Subsequently, it uses a theoretically-sound *Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping* method to convert the GRM's dense output into a reward signal that accelerates learning without altering the optimal policy. 
This approach is universally compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms.
